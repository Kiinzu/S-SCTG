# Components with Known Vulnerability

## Summary

There are many library and protocol out there that's built on the Ethereum Network. Using their functions and inheriting them to our contract is as simple as using the import or just declaring our smart contract is some-protocol. As always, not all smart contract there is 100% secure and some of them even hanging somewhere out there eventhough they know it has some issues.

## Test Objectives

- Ensure there are no library or components with known vulnerability.
- Ensure that all library or components is security checked/audited before.

## How to Test

The test that will be conducted for this section is as simple as doing `Google Search` on the protocol history. Like for example the zkSync, it has an audit history on Code4rena
