# Blockchain Essentials
You'll find a quick-guide to start your journey here.

### EVM

**Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** often known as "The World Computer" because anyone can simply run the Ethereum node on their Computer without being held back by their OS, also is a **stack-based** virtual machine.

### Solidity

Solidity is a EVM Compatible programming language that is used by the Ethereum Network. Throughout the years, Solidity has received many bugs-fix scenarios and now has the latest version of **0.8.29** (as of January 2025).  

Just like C which is a high level programming langauge, Solidity is also a high level programming language and in order to be executed by the EVM, the Solidity code first must be compile into **Bytecodes**, only after that the EVM can execute the code.

### Consensus

There are 2 consensus protocol that Ethereum uses, 
1. **Proof-of-Work(PoW)** 
2. **Proof-of-Stake(PoS)** (current)

### Accounts

There are 2 types of Account in Ethereum, the one that people like us might have is called **External Owned Account (EOA)**, and the other one is a **Smart Contract**. The difference is very obvious, only EOA has a private key.

### Wallets

Talking about wallets could be quite complicated, but here me out, it won't.

1. **Custodial/Non-Custodial Wallets**
This types of wallet is depend on who holds the private key, if it's the owner who hold it, then it is a **non-custodial wallets**, if it's a third party who holds the key, then it's a **custodial wallets**. Just think like having a wallet in a CEX and a Metamask/Rabby Wallet.  

2. **Hot/Cold Wallets**
Hot and Cold, if you have the physical form of the wallet like Trezor or Xellar Cards, then it's a **Hot Wallet**. If you only have the virtual form, like the physical thing doesn't exist, that's a **Cold Wallets**.
