# Solidity Smart Contract Testing Guide (S-SCTG)

Smol guide to audit a Solidity Smart Contract.

## The Idea

The Idea behind this **Solidity Smart Contract Testing Guide(S-SCTG)** is to provide a comprehensive and structured approach for testing smart contract, mainly inspired by [Smart Contract Security Verification Standart(SCSVS)](https://github.com/securing/SCSVS), [Immunefi Web3 Security Library](https://github.com/immunefi-team/Web3-Security-Library), DevCon 7 Bangkok Security Presentations and mediums.

While **SCSVS** is more suitable for the developers team, this testing frameworks will be focused on the security side- or designed to be used by **Smart Contract Auditor**. 

On the other hand, this guide hopes to give you a catalyst to further understand blockchain security.
